This module began as an adPython plugin (adPythonDataMatrix). The original
plugin combined detection and reading of datamatrices with details about the
geometry of the i04-1 sample pucks (see
/home/ecw19626/datamatrix/test-images/barcode_43.tif for an example).

The idea of this module is to contain the datamatrix detection/reading code
without any of the details of the puck geometry. This module should provide a
function which takes an image containing datamatrices and returns the decoded
datamatrix strings and information about their position in the image.

The adPython plugin worked by locating datamatrices and sending a region of
interest containing a datamatrix to libdmtx, which would then itself attempt to
locate and decode the datamatrix in the region of interest. This was unreliable
so I decided to write a basic datamatrix decoder in Python. This doesn't cover
the whole of the Data Matrix specification and doesn't (yet!) make use of the
Reed-Solomon error correction bits built in to each datamatrix, but works
faster and more reliably in conjunction with the rest of the module, compared
to libdmtx.
