    <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-344/>

* Install numpy:
    * Windows binary from: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/>

* Install scipy:
    * Windows binary from: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/>

    * Note: OpenCV themselves do not seem to provide an installer that is compatible with Python 3.4
    * Download the appropriate wheel file from: <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv>
    * Install the wheel file with `pip install file_name`
